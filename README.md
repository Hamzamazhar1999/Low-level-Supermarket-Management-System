# Low-level-Supermarket-Management-System using CLI

The major goal of this project was to create a C++ Object Oriented based program that would perform basic billing and stock management tasks. The Code will be divided into two modules, Manager and Costumer. The customer will be asked to make an account in which all the details will be asked. The stock will be managed and updated. The customer will be able to add to cart the items he wishes to buy, and he will be able to view the final bill and also give feedback. The manager will be able to manage the stock i.e. increase and decrease it. The manager will be warned in case an item goes out of stock.
